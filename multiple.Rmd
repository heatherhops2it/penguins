## Relationship between multiple traits

An exploration of the relationship between body size (mass, in g) and flipper size (length, mm). Different species are indicated.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

ggplot(data = penguins, mapping = aes(x = body_mass_g, y = flipper_length_mm, colour = species, shape = species)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = lm)

```
