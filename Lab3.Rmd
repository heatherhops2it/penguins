## Data

Today we are using data collected and made available by [Dr Kristen Gorman](https://www.uaf.edu/cfos/people/faculty/detail/kristen-gorman.php) and the [Palmer Station](https://pallter.marine.rutgers.edu/). The dataset contains information on 344 individuals of 3 species of penguin.

```{r, include=FALSE}

## Single trait distribution

First, we will plot out the distribution of the bill length of each species. Note that some bill lengths overlap. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

ggplot(data = penguins) + geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm, fill = species), alpha = 0.75) + facet_wrap(~ species, nrow = 3)

```

## Relationship between multiple traits

An exploration of the relationship between body size (mass, in g) and flipper size (length, mm). Different species are indicated.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

ggplot(data = penguins, mapping = aes(x = body_mass_g, y = flipper_length_mm, colour = species, shape = species)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = lm)

```
