## Data

Today we are using data collected and made available by [Dr Kristen Gorman](https://www.uaf.edu/cfos/people/faculty/detail/kristen-gorman.php) and the [Palmer Station](https://pallter.marine.rutgers.edu/). The dataset contains information on 344 individuals of 3 species of penguin.

## Single trait distribution

First, we will plot out the distribution of the bill length of each species. Note that some bill lengths overlap. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

ggplot(data = penguins) + geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm, fill = species), alpha = 0.75) + facet_wrap(~ species, nrow = 3)

```

## Relationship between multiple traits

An exploration of the relationship between body size (mass, in g) and flipper size (length, mm). Different species are indicated.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

ggplot(data = penguins, mapping = aes(x = body_mass_g, y = flipper_length_mm, colour = species, shape = species)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = lm)

```

## Sexual dimorphism

Let's take a look at sexually dimorphic traits across the three species.

First, bill depth:

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

ggplot(data = subset(penguins, !is.na(sex)), mapping = aes(x = bill_depth_mm)) +
  geom_density(aes(fill = species), alpha = 0.5) +
  facet_wrap(~ sex, nrow = 3)

```

Additionally, we can look at flipper length:

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

ggplot(data = subset(penguins, !is.na(sex)), mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm)) +
  geom_density(aes(fill = species), alpha = 0.5) +
  facet_wrap(~ sex, nrow = 3)

```

On a visual inspection of the two plots, bill depth appears to be a sexually dimorphic trait in all three species, with males having deeper bills than females. Flipper length, by comparison, is more strongly sexually dimorphic in Gentoo penguins than in Adelie and Chinstrap penguins. 

Finally, let us look at whether body mass is sexually dimorphic:

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

ggplot(data = subset(penguins, !is.na(sex)), mapping = aes(x = sex, y = body_mass_g, colour = sex)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  facet_wrap(~ species)

```
